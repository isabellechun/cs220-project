      <h5>Scenario 1</h5>
      <div>
      <h6> Pre-Law Society decides what to sell</h6>
        Wendy is president of pre-law society and is looking to fundraise for an upcoming lecture by an attorney at a big law firm in New York City. In order for this lecture to happen, pre-law society must provide adequate funds for the lecturer’s transportation by plane from NYC to Boston. She wants to ensure that they have enough money for this, as the club has been suffering from low event attendance, and this speaker could change that. She holds an e-board meeting with fellow members of the pre-law society in order to determine what to sell to students on campus. Since pre-law society hasn’t fundraised in a while, a week before the meeting, she decides to make an account on EatsWell for pre-law society and search the newsfeed for inspiration to see what other organizations on Wellesley’s campus recently have sold/are selling. She quickly creates a poll to see what people would be interested in purchasing and finds the manual that details the process (as well as tips and tricks) for fundraising for organizations and a list of popular vendors in the area. The following week, Wendy brings all of this information to the e-board meeting, and they spend a little under 10 minutes brainstorming potential food items they might want to sell, such as drinks, snacks, or meals, based on poll results. In the end, they narrow their options down to two items: ramen or boba since those were the two that were the most popular and highly requested. Eventually, they go with Boba, since EatsWell mentioned a vendor that would allow them to bulk order for a good price, allowing them to make a substantial profit.

      <br></br>
      <h5>Scenario 2</h5>
      <div>
        <h6> Publicity and Preorder Logistics</h6>
        After deciding on selling boba, Wendy hops back on the EatsWell to begin the process for the fundraiser. She begins by looking at the event calendar, to make sure no other orgs are selling boba the week before spring break. She thinks that week will be a good time, as midterms and exams are prominent, and students would want to treat themselves while studying. She then fills out the form, entering in the logistical information for the fundraiser. However, she isn’t sure what flavors of boba to order. She swiftly creates another poll on EatsWell to gauge interest in the flavors. She receives responses quickly, and the top flavors include: thai tea, milk tea, and taro tea. Once flavors are confirmed, she reaches out to the vendor listed on the EatsWell that offers a bulk discount to Wellesley organizations. Wendy finds out that Tea-Do and KungFu both offer a deal where students groups can buy boba tea in bulk, and they will deliver the boba tea to campus. Kung Fu tea is offering to give pre-law society boba tea for $3 a cup, and Tea-Do is also offering to sell boba tea at $3 a cup. Pre-law society decides to go with KungFu tea because they are closer and it would be cheaper for the members to pick up the tea. Once the dates, vendor, and flavors are confirmed, Wendy creates a preorder form and changes the status of the boba sale from “draft” to “live” on the app. The preorder form includes the date of boba delivery, and an additional poll at the end asking for future feedback. This takes her less than 5 minutes, and soon, orders start pouring in. The form is open for a week, and once an order is placed, the EatsWell redirects to pre-law society’s venmo page, making the payment process swift and easy. When Wendy logs back on to EatsWell the following week, when the preorder form has closed, she finds a compiled list of the names of people who have ordered, their order, whether or not their payment was received through venmo, and if they wanted to have their boba delivered or pick it up. After double checking the relevant information was in order and received, she orders boba through the vendor, and decides to order several extra to sell on the day of.
        <br></br>
        The day of the boba sale arrives, and Wendy goes with her co-president to pick up the drinks with the vendor. They continually update and post the status of their delivery on the EatsWell. When the preorders arrive on campus, pre-law society posts on the app that preorders have arrived and there are extra drinks available for purchase in Lulu and Bates for anyone who is craving boba right now. For those who chose delivery, the pre-law society posts their whereabouts during the delivery window, so people can easily be notified if they are close to a certain dorm. Before each person picks up their drink, Wendy verifies that their payment has been received through venmo. If not, she accepts cash before giving the boba to customers.

    <h4>Design Directions</h4>
    <p style="color: red"> add images of drawings!!</p>
    App Home Screen: User selects student view, if seeking to preorder or purchase food, or organization view, if looking to sell food.
    <br/>
    Student Home Page: Allows students to navigate to live feed of what organizations are actively selling food, their upcoming orders, all upcoming fundraisers as well, and access to their profile as well.
    <br/>
    Profile Page: Students can connect their venmo and change their profile settings on this page. Students can leave feedback about the app and see their previous orders.
    <br/>
    Live Feed: Feed of notifications from all orgs about updates on their fundraisers here. Updates can include delivery time updates, notifications about selling out of a specific item/flavor, details about specific pickup location, free food leftover from events.
    <br/>
    Upcoming Fundraisers: On this page, students and orgs can see what orgs are selling and use this page to get to the preorder forms. Students swipe through each view, which provides basic information about a fundraiser (item being sold, price, club/org). When a club wants to put a short poll on the app (1-3 questions) to gauge interest, it would also be a box within this swipe screen.

      <h4>Takeaways</h4>
      After receiving feedback on these preliminary designs, our designs will focus more on the student user view and actions in the app than the organization view.
      What does the user see when she first opens the app?

      Changes to our design include adding push notification that notifies the user on the upcoming weekly fundraisers, adding check boxes instead of filling in the blank for the pre-order form, and getting user feedback on the app.
With the focus of user experience throughout the app in mind, the user will be able to go into their profile to adjust their preferences settings. The user will be able to view a past orders section that details their past orders and the orders that are in process of being delivered. Users will be able to filter not only by allergies, but also by price, food item...etc. If the user orders something, the user will receive order confirmation feedback in the form of a pop-up box. In general, the user will have more user feedback pop-ups for completed user actions.
In terms of the visual app design, pages will follow a grid format, and there will be more focus on how pieces of the app are connected.
Since we know how important dates are to the user, we will highlight time left on a pre-order form for a fundraiser before it closes using a mechanism.
It could be push notification, color change on the fundraiser box, etc.
    When new organizations create their first accounts, we prompt a verification with the organization's SOFC account number.
