      <h4>"Risky" Interactions</h4>
      An individual is both a student user who orders from fundraisers, and an approved admin of an org who hosts fundraisers.
      She is logged into her organization’s account and places an order for a fundraiser, intending to pay through her personal account, but her organization’s account is charged.
      <br></br>
      Solution: Organizations can collect money, but can’t place orders to buy from other fundraisers.
      Students can view and order from fundraisers, but cannot host fundraisers.
      Organizations must be authenticated and/or constitutionally recognized by College Government to have an account on EatsWell.
      The login email associated with an organization's account can only be its official WCSO email.
      Instead of allowing a new user to create an organization account, every organization would receive an account invitation from the app.
      Linked to every organization is its SOFC account number, with which their account is validated during onboarding.

      <br></br>
      Organizations can start writing out their fundraiser description and order form and save it as a draft until they are ready to make their fundraiser live.
      An organization accidentally sets their fundraiser live and realizes their mistake an hour later, after having received $35 for preorders.
      <br></br>
      Solution: Display a preview of the fundraiser description, then click confirm to publish a fundraiser.
      These additional confirmations clearly differentiate the process of saving a fundraiser draft from beginning to accept preorders.
      Fundraisers are always editable (except pickup date and time).
      The end date of preorders can always be extended.
