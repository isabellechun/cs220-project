    <h4>Usability Testing</h4>
    <p>
      During our Usability Testing, we examined three tasks: preordering from a
       fundraiser as a student, posting to the live feed as an organization, and
       creating a fundraiser as an organization. We did a total of four tests,
       two for preordering from a fundraiser, one for the live feed, and one
       from creating a fundraiser.
     </p>
     <!-- <br/> -->
     <p>
       	To evaluate the preordering from a fundraiser task, we conducted two usability tests on the User Testing platform. The users were asked to imagine themselves as students and preorder using the calendar view first, and then the upcoming fundraisers view second. We tested this protocol in order to clarify which one would be prefered, and if having two ways to order would be necessary, or redundant. Both users went through the same protocol, and asked the same questions. Overall, their opinions matched: both were frustrated by the calendar view, as it did not show enough information about what was being sold compared to the upcoming fundraisers view. One user specifically mentioned that it was easier to navigate the upcoming fundraisers view, as everything important was in one place, compared to having to search around for fundraisers with the calendar view. Both users were consistent in their evaluations, and able to complete the task of preordering from a fundraiser easily and quickly.
      </p>
      <!-- <br/> -->
      <p>
	The next user’s task was to post to the live feed as a member of an organization.
  This overall was not too difficult, as the user managed to finish this task in
  under 3 minutes. However, this user accidentally clicked “I am a student” when
  starting this task, when in fact they should have clicked “I am an organization”.
  This led them astray for a while, but eventually they figured it out.
  We think this happened because they did not read the directions carefully,
  and not due to our directions, which clearly stated that the user was a member
  of an organization.
</p>
<!-- <br/> -->
<p>
	Finally, the last task was to create a fundraiser as a member of an organization. At first, the user was confused on the “create a new fundraiser” page. She was looking for visual feedback when she made a selection, but there was none. She spent a lot of time clicking through the dropdowns to see if something would happen. But, our dropdowns were not responsive to selection, something we plan to change in prototype 2.0. However, other than that, the user thought it was pretty easy to use, and was able to create a fundraiser and preview it.
</p>
<!-- <br/> -->
<p>
Users appreciated the “clean and modern design/look”, and overall, rated the website highly (mean = 8/10).
Another user “liked that it [website] wasn't too cluttered” and that it was
“simple enough to know where to go”. One user highlighted that the website was
“quick and easy to use”, which was one of our main goals. We also did get some
feedback to improve the graphic design, as well as the UI/UX elements of EatsWell.
 For example, in prototype 2.0, we plan to update the EatsWell logo at the top of the screen, so if a user clicks it, it takes them to the home page automatically. If we had more time, we would go back and add additional flourishes to improve the aesthetic of the website (as it looks a bit bare right now), and incorporate more user feedback to update certain features (e.g. if a person ordered two bobas, the price would automatically update so the total would be $12. User would not have to do any math).
</p>

  <h4>Next Iteration</h4>
    <p>
    In summary, our takeaways from usability testing are the following:
    to remove the calendar view, and instead only use the upcoming fundraisers
    view to display fundraisers for the student;
    clicking on the EatsWell logo at the top of the webpage should take
    the user to the home page (i.e. for the student, this would be the upcoming
    fundraisers view, and for the organization, it would be the calendar view);
    finally, when organizations are creating a fundraiser, there should be a
    responsive design (e.g. when they click on something, it should bold/there
    should be a visual response).
