    <h1>User Analysis</h1>

    <section>
      <h4>Initial Design Direction</h4>
      <p>
        Initially, we were focused on redesigning Wellesley’s DISH website. The site’s current format doesn’t allow for an easy or enjoyable experience of finding meals served by a dining hall in a given day. We wanted to change the layout so that students could clearly see all three meals offered on a single day as well as compare them with meals served by other dining halls. It was also important that students could find meals according to their allergy and dietary restrictions as that also influences both where and what they eat every day.
      </p>

      <h4>Contextual Inquiry Takeaways</h4>
      <p>
        For our contextual inquiry, we interviewed student athletes, students who have allergies, students who live off campus, as well as students who do not enjoy the meal plan. As a result of the loss of school-wide emails, a new problem has risen in terms of communicating with the student population. From these conversations with these potential users, we found that they generally wanted an easier way of finding food on (as well as off) campus that involved fewer clicks, a mobile-friendly interface, a way to compare meals across dining halls, and a way to filter results.
