    <h4>Prototype 2.0 Improvements</h4>
    <p>
      Our key improvements in our prototype 2.0 are the following: removing the calendar view, and instead only use the upcoming fundraisers view to display fundraisers for the student; clicking on the EatsWell logo at the top of the webpage should take the user to the home page (i.e.. for the student, this would be the upcoming fundraisers view, and for the organization, it would be the calendar view); finally, tweaking the create a fundraiser page for the organization. When organizations are creating a fundraiser, we decided to implement a responsive design (e.g. when they click on something, it should be bold/there should be a visual response).

  <h4>Team Takeaways</h4>
    <p>
      Overall, Team BIAS worked very well together!
      During the semester, we kept each other motivated and accountable through
      our biweekly meetings. We had a philosophy of open and honest communication
      and considered all perspectives before making any final decisions.
      Due to the Covid19 pandemic, our team had to work remotely on EatsWell.
      However, our team used web calls during our meetings even before the pandemic
      happened, which helped ease the transition during the second half of the semester.
      We were all happy to continue working together, but the pandemic made it
      difficult for us to balance work with all that was happening around us,
      because normally, we would be able to dedicate more time and energy to
      EatsWell. This was not always the case at home. However, because we were
      consistent with our meetings and check ins, we were able to stay on track
      with our project. We employed numerous strategies early on which helped us
      save time such as: creating a web prototype bootstrap template and a style
      guide (complete with colors, emojis, and fonts); writing meeting agendas
      before every check in; constructing a Team BIAS Trello board and Slack
      group; and keeping records of what we had completed and talked about
      during meetings. Best of all, our team GitHub worked! We all felt supported
      by one another, and were comfortable asking for help when needed.
      In the future, to take this project forward, we would incorporate a
      functioning backend, as well as test this prototype with actual members
      from the Wellesley community, in order to garner their feedback and see if
      they would actually use it.
